# Function With Frontend
For this project, create a simple contract with 2-3 functions. Then show the values of those functions in frontend of the application. 

 <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Public State Variables:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><code>Owner</code>: Public variable storing the address of the contract owner..</li>
                <li><code>Balance</code>:  Public variable holding the current balance of the contract..</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Functions:</b>
            <ul>
                <li><code>deposit</code>: Public function that allows the contract owner to deposit _amount of Ether into the contract..</li>
                <li><code>withdrawal</code>: Public function that allows the contract owner to withdraw _withdrawAmount of Ether from the contract..</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Functionality</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Smart contract has at least two functions.</li>
        <li>Value of the functions from the smart contract are visible on the frontend of the application.</li>
        <li>This Solidity contract Tasks functions similarly to the previous one, providing basic functionalities to deposit and withdraw Ether.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that only the owner can perform these actions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Deploying the Contract</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Code read-aloud is submitted.</li>
        <li>Code read-aloud is complete (all steps explained).</li>
        <li>Code read-aloud is clear and understandable.</li>
        <li>Conduct the test by yourself.</li>
    </ol>
